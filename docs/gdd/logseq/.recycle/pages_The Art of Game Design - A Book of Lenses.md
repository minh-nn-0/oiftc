  heading:: 1
	- Good [[Game Design]] happens when we view the game we want to make from as many perspectives as possible. Author referred to this as **lenses**, each one is a small set of questions, a way of viewing the design
	- **The Most Important Skill** for a Game Designer is **[[Listening]]**
		- [[Game Designer]] have to listen to many things: team, audience, client, game and self.
		- **Listening** here mean truly deep and thoughtful listening
			- > *To listen with a silent heart, with a waiting, open soul. Without passion, with-
			  out desire, without judgment, without rebuke.*
			  --- Siddhartha (Herman Hesse)
			- Approach things as a child does, assume nothing, observe everything, accept risk of upset, of the possibility that everything we know maybe contradicted. It is the ultimate of [[Open-mindedness]]
	- **The designer creates an [[Experience]]**
		- > *Ultimately, a game designer does not care about games. Games are merely a
		  means to an end. On their own, games are just artifacts—clumps of cardboard or
		  bags of bits. Games are worthless unless people play them. Why is this? What magic
		  happens when games are played?
		  When people play games, they have an experience. It is this experience that the
		  designer cares about. Without the experience, the game is worthless.*
		- The game is not the experience, the game enables the experience, but it's not the experience.
			- >  *“If a tree falls in the forest, and no one is there to hear it, does it make a
			  sound?”*
