- # Concerns
	- Game [[Space]] is continuous
	- Can have multiple floor/platform/rooms
	- Should support [[Theme]]
	- Should encourage [[experimentation]]
	- The [[Goals]] should be clear
- # Components
	- [[Player]]
	- [[Messes]]
	- [[Objects]]
	- [[Tools]]
	- How are level components different / related ? #question #level
		- #example:
			- Messes: [[Dust]]
			- Can use [[Broom]] or [[Vacuum]] or a sheet of paper
		- [[Messes]] can not be picked up ?
		- [[Objects]] may or may not be picked up, overall can interact ?
		- [[Objects]] can be used too ? Like a toothbrush
		- -> [[Tools]] is [[Objects]] ?
			- What are their attribute to be functional ?
				- If it can be used when put in #hotslot, it's a [[Tools]] ?
					- So [[Tools]] is just something specialize in cleaning, which we may not need to define rigidly, just make some attribute that make it efficient to cleaning ? #idea
						- #example: What makes a [[Broom]] efficient for handling [[Dust]] ? #question #Mechanic
		- -> [[Messes]] and [[Tools]] are [[Objects]] ? #question #Mechanic
			- For example we can identify what object is by their tileid
			  collapsed:: true
				- But what about bigger objects like fridge and closet
					- We can identify by one unique tile (like body of the fridge for example), doesn't have to know whole shape, because that unique tile never goes alone.
					- We can modify them too by knowing their tilemap relationships (fridge body is at center, their left, right, up, down tile we can defer from that)
					- -> We know what is under player feet at any given time.
			- Do we need [[Items]], are [[Items]] also [[Objects]] ?
				- So whatever can go in [[Inventory]] is [[Items]], or more specifically, [[Inventory]] can only holds [[Objects]] that are [[Items]] ? #idea
					- So [[Objects]] are scattered in the levels, if they can be picked up and put in [[Inventory]], they become [[Items]]
						- Do we need that transformation ? What information [[Items]] holds that [[Objects]] don't ?
							- Literally nothing
						- If we decided to drop [[Items]] from [[Inventory]], they become [[Objects]] again ?
							- Doesn't need to be that complicated
						- #conclusion: Doesn't need distinction between [[Items]] and [[Objects]]. Everything we store in [[Inventory]] is called [[Items]], but that's for calling, not for separate data/type in code
				- #conclusion: Everything that can be interacted is [[Objects]]. We can identify what **type** it ([[Messes]], [[Tools]]) is by its tile id, then run corresponding [[System]] on it.

					- Much more versatile, now even a wall can be a mess
					- [[System]] can collect data it needs at the start of each level.
					- The main distinction is [[Messes]] and the rest
