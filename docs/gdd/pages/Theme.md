## #Chaos and #Order
	- The game highlights the dynamic tension between disorder and the satisfaction of restoring #balance.
	- Players face #Chaos through unpredictable [[Messes]], [[Tools]] and [[Objects]] that can interact with one another in surprising ways. As players clean and tidy, they bring back #Order and #balance.
	- This ebb and flow of #Chaos and #Order creates a satisfying rhythmâ€”each level starts as a chaotic mess, and through a series of well-timed actions, players restore order, but only to have #Chaos return in new forms as they move to the next challenge.
