- ((673e1ef4-4d9d-46a6-bd3b-b71d3d679e55))
	- In future levels, if follow this, player will become familiar with gameloop and start to looks for certain things right away #level-design #keep-in-mind
		- [[Objects]] (including [[Messes]])
		- [[Water Source]]
- [[Water Source]] is an important part of cleaning that we didn't even think about
	- An interesting mechanic:
		- Can create leak or overflow
		- Can make mop more realistic
-
- It would make sense for player to move and sweep/mop at the same time. Everywhere player goes while using a [[Broom]] for example, if there is [[Dust]] it makes a [[Dust Pile]] which grow bigger and bigger and move with player #idea #mechanic
  id:: 673ea1b0-a837-4940-9942-e5d412c9512b
	- Make another [[Mechanic]] for a [[Dustpan]]
		- But dustpan are usually not usable on its own, it needs another [[Broom]] -> use 1 hotslot is not possible ?
		- -> Make a [[Dustpan and Brush]]
	- Then how to dispose (we have a [[Trash Bin]])
		- [[Dustpan and Brush]] have capacity, after being used will collect whatever [[Dust Pile]]
		- #+BEGIN_NOTE
		  Have to make separate tile texture for each level of capacity
		  #+END_NOTE
		- If a [[Dust Pile]] too big it will not hold full of it -> that pile get smaller -> have to used many times
		  id:: 673eb4d2-854a-4ed9-b5a0-1461e0ee76ad
		-
		- Then when use at [[Trash Bin]], it get disposed
			- ((673e1dfd-94ad-48f3-ab81-637746e7ec47))
		-
	- But we have to make it clear that the floor is not cleaned
		- Made some scrap tile, looks not bad
	- #+BEGIN_WARNING
	  This would escalate to be too complicated very quickly
	  #+END_WARNING
	- Then it would make sense that if player move too fast or piles too big, that dust piles breaks down, leave dust and scraps behind
		- Will premade assets looks good enough (Yes)
	- -> Requires player to be more cautious, but we need to make sure that system goes smooth (execution matter)
	- -> Emphasize more on #efficiency #planning
-
- Should we calculate score based on every mess cleaned or based on "cleanliness". How would it works? #idea
  id:: 673eb092-d88c-4148-b0e5-265b5f1d4ba2
	- Base on area of level ?
	- Base on initial amount of messes ?
	- How we wants player to approach the level ? #question
		- Clean as much as possible, score added on completion of each messes (Eliminate to score), emphasize on #instant-feedback #action-oriented
		  id:: 673eb1ad-6f5d-4bd8-ac5a-affc2d104b5b
		- Keep it clean as much as possible, score are revealed at the end of level (Preserve to score), emphasize on #strategic #planning
		- Should we keep both ? #idea #mechanic
			- Yes, strive for #balance and #diversity
-
- There should be a [[Mechanic]] for collecting garbage, or organizing [[Objects]] in the room
	- New item: [[Trash Bag]] #idea #Mechanic
-
- Should we have multiple game world, in which each level is the same, just different in messes layout ? #question #idea #level-design
	- Pros:
		- Can introduce mechanic more easily, player doesn't have to remember where [[Objects]] and [[Station]] are
		- -> More #casual and #relaxing gameplay
	- Cons:
		- May become repetitive
		- -> Level needs to be bigger to make room for many possible messes layout
		- -> Overall reduce #chaos
	- -> Yes, [[Theme]] is more about fun and casual gameplay than difficulty
	- #conclusion: Make different [[World]], which contain one template for [[level]]. This include static [[Area]], predictable [[Objects]]. Each should have minor variations like different [[Objects]], locked [[Room]],... #level-design
- -> Some [[World]] ideas
	- One way is multiple house layout
	- Another way is multiple settings (Household, Office)
	- -> Go with multiple house layout for now
