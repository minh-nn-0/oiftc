- What exactly are the steps for this [[PT_1]]
	- DONE Level loading
	- [[Inventory]]
	- [[Objects]] loading
-
- Done some functions for level (get time limit, get door near player)
-
- Start objects.tsv, for now we have name, tile id (int) and size (vec2)
	- tile id is the upper left tile of object
		- #example object.tsv
			- |name | tileid | size |
			  |dust | 1 | 1,1|
			  |broom|3|2,1|
	- Why would we this this after all ?
		- If something can be store in inventory, it would be as small as one tile
		- Should we make several icon to display in inventory instead ?
		- Because big object like broom will not be in inventory, we have to display it somehow
			- Need to make different animation for each
			- How about just let it floating alongside player ? #idea

				- Worth a try
				- Can create uniqueness - or quirky
			- How about a "cleaning cart"
				- Doesn't make sense too
