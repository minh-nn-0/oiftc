- Should we layout [[Objects]] in the level beforehand or randomize it
	- Go with both
	- That can leads to [[Game mode]]
-
- Game should have some kind of primitive action
	- Each should have one predictable function
	- Like in minecraft, we know that use left mouse is attack, right mouse is interactive (with tool)
	- Each primitive action have similar animation however it is used.
-
- Make it simpler
	- [[Broom]] won't go wet, there is no water on the floor to be exact (too hard to make it look good)
	- [[Dustpan]] now is used by putting it to the ground ([[Drop]] button) and sweep dust into it
	- [[Dust Pile]] have 4 level of size
- TODO Tutorial map
	- [[Dust]] and [[Dust Pile]] when collide form bigger [[Dust Pile]]
		- Maybe make it progress up
			- 1 small dust + 1 small dust = 1 small dust pile.
			- 2 small dust (1 small dust pile)+ 1 small dust pile = medium dust pile
			- -> 2 of each dust pile form bigger dust pile
	- [[Dust]] and [[Dust Pile]] can be moved with [[Broom]]
		- Move dust from center of player sprite to X pixel at the facing direction
		- -> If dust is in range (player sprite center), move it
	- If broom while moving on too big [[Dust Pile]], it spread
		- How big is too big ?
			- Maybe just the biggest (8 dust)
		- How much to spread (i.e reduce the pile)
			- 1/4
	- How [[Dustpan]] works
		- How much it can handle ?
			- level 3 pile
