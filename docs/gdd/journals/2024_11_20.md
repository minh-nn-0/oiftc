- What happens when an [[Interactions]] occur ? #question #Mechanic
	- If it involve [[Player]]
		- Change animation
		- Change state ?
- How to structure and load levels ? #question #Level
	- Have [[Player]], [[Timer]], [[Messes]], [[Objects]] and [[Tools]]
	- Each is updated each frame.
	-
- Level contains **description** of how data should be use. Data contains elsewhere, or inside the map itself #idea #Level
	- Level doesn't contains [[Objects]], it fetch some data about what [[Objects]] there are in the map
	- What data do we need for [[Interactions]]? #question #mechanic
		- When picking up [[Objects]]
		- When cleaning (using [[Tools]])
			- What [[Items]] or [[Tools]] player currently holding in #hotslot
				- Should hotslot only allow [[Tools]] ? #question #mechanic #Inventory
			- How [[Messes]] knows that its being cleaned ?
	- How [[Objects]] interact with each other ? #question #Mechanic
		- Through external [[System]] (aka through an #Interface)?
			- By sending interaction data (how an object want to interact with the level)
	- #example of [[Interactions]]
		- [[Dust]] will be cleaned by a dry [[Broom]]
-
- Think about **functionality**, not **form** #design-principle
-
- Actions should be easy to remember #button-layout
	- 4 buttons for Movement (Player and in [[Inventory]])
	- One for
		- using #hotslot (action in other games)
		- Interaction
			- picking up [[Objects]]
			- use [[Objects]] nearby
			- Should we separate picking and using to two button ? (if an object can be pickup and used at the same time) #question
		- open [[Inventory]]

	- There is a [[Dust]] on the floor and a [[Stains]] on the wall
	- There is [[Broom]] and [[Sponge]] in sight
	- Player go pickup that [[Broom]] to handle [[Dust]]
	- After cleaning [[Dust]], player wants to clean [[Stains]]
	- With common sense, player go grab [[Sponge]]
		- At this moment player should want [[Sponge]] to be in hotslot without having going to [[Inventory]] and swap
		- Player use [[Sponge]] on [[Stains]]
		- Everything goes smoothly, and player should have an idea of the game
	- If player wants to try [[Broom]] on [[Dust]]
		- > At this moment, we want to introduce dynamic interactions, but not something like a pop-up saying "You shouldn't do it". Instead let player see what will happens
		- [[Broom]] change visual (should be clear)
		- If continue using, it creates [[Stains]] while it is being used
		- Player should know by now that he shouldn't use [[Broom]] on [[Stains]]
		- Player may be curious about whether there is a way to clean the [[Broom]]
			- Go to nearby sink or water source
			- Realize there is no button for that
			- TODO Decide on how player clean [[Tools]]

				- If strive for #simplicity (which we should), we should reuse button
					- What button ? -> whatever feels intuitive
						- how about instead of using hotslot only trigger cleaning, it trigger different things based on context (will display of course)
							- Not very good, it can become messy and hard to keep track  if many objects. Besides that it lost the spirit of #experimentation and dynamic interaction. #level-design
						- So every [[Items]] should only have one way of behaving if used in hotslot (trigger only one animation)
				- -> Make another [[Objects]] type: [[Station]]
					-
		- If everything goes smoothly, player should have an impression that this game have depth in interactions and mechanic #impression

- Player should have a sense that this game has depth in mechanic right away #impression
