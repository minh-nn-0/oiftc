- Sum up [[gameplay]]
	- Player have to clean [[Messes]] throughout the level
	- Cleaning involves using [[Objects]] and [[Station]]
		- #example mechanics for now
			- [[Scrap]] and [[Garbage]] needs collecting and disposing at [[Trash Bin]] (can use [[Trash Bag]])
			- [[Mop]] needs cleaning during use using [[Water Source]] ([[Sink]] or [[Bucket]],...)
			- [[Broom]] if wet needs to dry (using timer)
			- Dirty [[Mop]] and [[Broom]] if continue using can cause more [[Messes]] to appear
			- [[Dust]] and [[Scrap]] can be swept by [[Broom]] or similar things, creating [[Dust Pile]]
				- Should everything small and light enough can be swept ? #question #Mechanic
			- Player can move and swept at the same time, moving [[Dust Pile]] or similar things with them
				- Should only [[Dust Pile]] can be move like this ? #question #Mechanic
					- It would kinda make sense, and reduce #complexity
				- Would it be interesting visually enough without physics ? Or anything will just moving straight X-wise and not rotating or whatever ? #question #mechanic
			- Sweeping large [[Dust Pile]] while moving will randomly spread [[Dust]] behind
				- For realism, we can keep track of what [[Scrap]] is in the pile, then randomly spread them #idea #Mechanic

	- Player's score is calculated immediately through cleaning and at level's end through "cleanliness"
	- Game have different [[World]] and each have similar [[level]]s

- Consider adding character customization (how ?)
